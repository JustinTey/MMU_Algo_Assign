# MMU_Algo_Assign

Assignment during MMU Trimester 2 19/20

Implementation of QuickSelect with fixed and random pivot.
Implementation of MergeSort

Both Algorithm will be tested with the best case , average case and worst case input. 
Each cases will be tested with different input size as well.
Graph will be include when the test is final.

Cases for Mergesort:

Best Case = A sorted input.

Average Case = A random input.

Worst Case = An array with ODD on the left side while Even on the Right.

Cases for QuickSelect:

Best Case = A sorted array and the k term to find is the first element of the input.

Average Case = A scrambled input and any k term to find.

Worst Case = A sorted array and the k term to find is the last element of the input.

Instruction to run the program. 
1. Quick-select will be available in the quick-select folder.
2. Start with quickselect.cpp the basis of a quick-select algorithm program that use a average case and array size of 10.
3. If you would like to modify the n dynamicly, please open fixedPivot(N-size).cpp.
4. If you would like to try different cases, please open fixedPivot(testCase).cpp.
5. If you would like to try out random pivot, please open randomPivot.cpp.
6. Merge-sort will be available in the merge-sort folder.
7. Start with mergesort.cpp the basis of a merge-sort algorithm program that use a average case and array size of 10.
8. If you would like to modify the n dynamicly, please open mergesort(N-size).cpp.
9. If you would like to try different cases, please open mergesort(test-case).cpp.
