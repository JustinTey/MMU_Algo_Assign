# MMU_Algo_Assign

Assignment during MMU Trimester 2 19/20

Implementation of QuickSelect with fixed and random pivot.
Implementation of MergeSort

Both Algorithm will be tested with the best case , average case and worst case input. 
Each cases will be tested with different input size as well.
Graph will be include when the test is final.

Cases for Mergesort:
Best Case = A sorted input.
Average Case = Half of the input is sorted while the other half scrambled.
Worst Case = A desecding sorted input.

Cases for QuickSelect: ( Only fixed pivot will be used to test )
Best Case = A sorted array and the k term to find is the first element of the input.
Average Case = A scrambled input and any k term to find.
Worst Case = A sorted array and the k term to find is the last element of the input.
